# This is the source code of Bimbot v2

Basically, I decided Bimbot shall be using a fresh new code, with the most recent DiscordJS API (as of February 5th 2022).

But fear not: The initial commands are to be keeped.

## Command list
 -  b!ping
    >   Responds "Pong" and how long it took for the bot to send a reply.
    >   
    >   To check whether the bot is actually online and responsive.

## Staff only command list
 -  b!censor \<message id\>  (or)  b!censor (while replying to a message)
    >   Deletes the message that is within the channel, and resends it with censor brackets
    >   
    >   To put flashy gifs in a censor barrier, and protect epileptic people
 
 -  b!alert
    >   The bot-alert related commands
    >    -  b!alert list
    >       >   Responds with the list of word sequences that Bimbot is meant to recognize and alert staff about
    >    -  b!alert add \<word sequence\>
    >       >   Adds the given word sequence to the list
    >    -  b!alert remove \<word sequence\>
    >       >   Removes the given word sequence from the list
